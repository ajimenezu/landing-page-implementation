This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Enhanced Implementations

- Since the design does not have a corresponding title (h1) for the page but has other sections with titles corresponding to the h2 in the hierarchy, the page SEO will be affected. Because of this I decided to add a new title to the Hero Section over the image it has on the figma. This can be a workaround with the design team for a better implementation in case that is needed.

- The design also shows a Privacy text in the Footer for what it looks like is the Terms and Conditions section. This is something that is missing in the CMS and has to be defined there. For the moment I added this text to show where this has to be and need a proper definition on what links are needed and where they should be redirected.
